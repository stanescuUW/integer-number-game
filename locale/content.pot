"# The Rational Number Game, version 0.1beta\n"
"\n"
"## By Dan Stanescu \n"
"\n"
"# What is this game?\n"
"\n"
"Welcome to the rational number game -- a game to help undergraduates learn "
"analysis through Lean,\n"
"a formal proof verification system. The game explores some basic facts about "
"the rationals, \n"
"starting with the fact that the square root of two is not a rational "
"number.\n"
"\n"
"This game is a sequel to\n"
"<a href=\"http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/\" "
"target=\"blank\">the natural number game</a>.\n"
"The levels in the Rational Number Game need to be solved using tactics. To "
"learn how to use these tactics, I would\n"
"recommend that you first play the Natural Number Game up to at least "
"\"Advanced Proposition world\". I will\n"
"not go through a careful explanation of the tactics taught by the natural "
"number game here.\n"
"\n"
"Blue nodes in the graph on the right are ones that you are ready to enter. "
"Gray nodes you should stay away\n"
"from -- try blue ones higher up the chain first. Green nodes are completed.\n"
"\n"
"# Thanks\n"
"\n"
"Many thanks to both Kevin Buzzard and Mohammad Pedramfar, without whom this "
"game would not exist.\n"
"\n"
"# Questions?\n"
"\n"
"You can ask questions on the <a href=\"https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/\" "
"target=\"blank\">Lean Zulip chat</a>,\n"
"where I am often to be found. You can also ask me questions if you take a "
"class with me, or bump into me somewhere\n"
"on the UWyo campus.\n"
"\n"
"The Rational Number Game is brought to you by the UWyo Proof Games project.\n"
