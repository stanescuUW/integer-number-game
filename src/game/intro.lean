# The Rational Number Game, version 0.1beta

## By Dan Stanescu 

# What is this game?

Welcome to the rational number game -- a game to help undergraduates learn analysis through Lean,
a formal proof verification system. The game explores some basic facts about the rationals, 
starting with the fact that the square root of two is not a rational number.

This game is a sequel to
<a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/" target="blank">the natural number game</a>.
The levels in the Rational Number Game need to be solved using tactics. To learn how to use these tactics, I would
recommend that you first play the Natural Number Game up to at least "Advanced Proposition world". I will
not go through a careful explanation of the tactics taught by the natural number game here.

Blue nodes in the graph on the right are ones that you are ready to enter. Gray nodes you should stay away
from -- try blue ones higher up the chain first. Green nodes are completed.

# Thanks

Many thanks to both Kevin Buzzard and Mohammad Pedramfar, without whom this game would not exist.

where I am often to be found. You can also ask me questions if you take a class with me, or bump into me somewhere
on the UWyo campus.

The Rational Number Game is brought to you by the Proof Games project at the University of Wyoming, 
which aims to develop interactive tools for teaching and learning undergraduate mathematics.

Prove a theorem. Write a function. Learn more mathematics while having fun.
